##Files
####run_analysis.R
The "run_analysis.R"" script requires downloading and unziping the original raw data, which was generated during a set of experiments that study the data collected by a smartphone of subjects in specific positions and activities.  
The code performs transformations on the raw data and returns a Tidy data as an output in .txt format.
It can be launched using RStudio

####CodeBook.Rmd
Describes the operations performed by the script and the variables of the obtained data

####TidyAverage.txt
The 2nd output of the script run_analysis.R as described in the 5th step of the project Course

1.  Download the folder of the original raw Data here: [Download](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

2.  Unzip the file and set your RStudio working directory on the obtained file "./UCI HAR Dataset"

3.  Don't change or rename any file within the obtained folder to avoid errors while executing the script

4.  Required Packages: dplyr, plyr, tidyr
